# Book Finder

This is a web application that allows users to search for any book by title, author or genre, and add their favourites to a customizable list. That list is then stored locally on your system for future reference or editing.

## Lessons Learned

The biggest things I learned while completing this project was how to remove individual array items from local storage rather than simply remove the entire array. I gained a better understanding of how to work with the local storage api as a whole and improved my understanding and usage of callback functions. Most importantly, I learned how to solve problems instead of giving up on this project and finding something easier to create.
